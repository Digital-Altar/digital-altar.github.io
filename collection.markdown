<h1>Collected Works</h1>
<p>Blockchain technology allows for a transparent, decentralized, and secure way to manage ownership and provenance of artworks &mdash; providing artists and collectors with more control and autonomy over their collections. I've had the luck, opportunity, and privilege to collect some of my favorite art on Ethereum and Tezos, two popular blockchain platforms used for creating and trading such digital assets. Please enjoy this selection of works from my collection.</p>
