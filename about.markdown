<h1>Welcome</h1>
<h2>to Digital Altar</h2>
<h3>I design & create online experiences.</h3>
<br>
<p>My focus is on creating engaging digital experiences that are not only visually stunning, but also functional and user-friendly. My primary tools are art, code, and a great sense of empathy for the end user. My current active projects are concentrated within e-commerce and web3, two rapidly growing and ever-evolving fields in the digital world. I greatly enjoy helping others take their online presence to the next level, and find it rewarding to work with both artistic individuals and established brands.</p>
