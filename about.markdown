<h1>I design & create experiences.</h1>

<p>My art is rooted in the creation of digital experiences that are visually interesting and elicit thoughtfulness, while being functional and user-friendly. My primary tools are art, code, and a great sense of empathy for the end user.</p>

<p>My current active projects are concentrated within ai and web3 &mdash; two dynamic areas actively reshaping the digital world, each with its own unique challenges and opportunities. Through these mediums, I explore the way technology can be a conduit for communication and artistic expression.</p>

<p>This journey into digital art is driven by a desire to make the digital realm a space for meaningful artistic expression and innovation. By blending technical skills with a creative vision, I strive to produce work that not only enhances the online aesthetic but also invites viewers to engage with the digital world in new and thoughtful ways.</p>
