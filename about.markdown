		<h2>I design and create online experiences.</h2>
		<p>During the daylight hours, I weave my craft in the digital tapestry of e-commerce, focusing on the niche of luxury small businesses. It's a realm where art meets commerce, where each project is not just a task, but a story waiting to unfold. I bring life to online spaces, ensuring they are visually enchanting, provoke thought, and remain functional and user-friendly. My tools: a blend of artistry, coding finesse, and an empathetic heart that beats for the user at the other end.</p>
		<p>By night, I voyage through the uncharted waters of AI and web3 â€” twin beacons reshaping our digital shores. Here, I explore the potential of technology as a medium for communication, a canvas for artistic expression. It's a journey that challenges and inspires, pushing the boundaries of what we believe is possible in the digital realm.</p>
		<p>But who am I beyond the screen? In the "real" world, I'm a partner, a friend to two feline souls, and a gardener whose hands, so accustomed to keyboards and cables, find solace in the earth. This juxtaposition of lives enriches me, lending depth to my digital creations.</p>
		<p>This expedition into digital artistry is more than a career; it's a quest for meaning in the pixelated shadows of our existence. By fusing technical skill with a visionary's eye, I aim to craft experiences that not only elevate the digital aesthetic but also invite the viewer into a dance of discovery and reflection.</p>
		<p>In this digital age, I stand at the crossroads of technology and art, crafting not just websites, but gateways to worlds unseen, experiences unfelt. Join me on this journey, and let's redefine the essence of the digital experience together.</p>
